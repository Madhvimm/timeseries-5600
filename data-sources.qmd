**Data Sources**

In our journey to uncover trends in water quality, we're leveraging critical datasets from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Six-Year Reviews. This comprehensive dataset examines the safety and quality of drinking water across three key periods—SYR2, SYR3, and SYR4—showcasing the EPA's dedication to maintaining high drinking water standards through periodic reassessment based on the latest scientific research and technological advancements. A team of experts has rigorously quality-checked this data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for in-depth analysis.

**Primary Data Sources:**

 - **EIDC Dataset:** This broad dataset provides an overarching view of water quality data, serving as our analytical starting point. It encompasses a wide array of contaminants and offers insights into national water quality trends.

Each dataset not only informs our understanding of historical and current water quality but also plays a crucial role in identifying areas for regulatory improvement and technological intervention. By integrating my academic knowledge with professional experience in policy implementation and sustainable development, this project aims to distill complex information into actionable insights, fostering public good through enhanced water quality management and policy development.
